# Principles, Policies, Standards, Guidelines, and Procedures
Although we often see "Policy" and "Standard" used interchangebly, each actually has a specific meaning.

Every document should contain boilerplate text which clearly defines the policy framework. For example:

The COMPANY Policy Framework consists of a series of documents which describes goals, objectives, requirements, recommendations, and procedures for various subject areas.
This constists of principles, policies, standards, guidelines, and procedures. It is important to understand the distinction and purpose of each within the framework. 

* *Values* are prescribed and adopted by the company board of directors and form the foundation by which the company works.  
* A *Principle* is a fundamental basis of a system of thought or belief about the way to behave..
* A *Policy* is a formal, brief, high-level statement that typically includes statements to require compliance with associated standards and regulatory requirements with a focus on the desired results and not the means of implementation.
* A *Standard* contains the mandatory and recommended actions and rules to support and conform to a given policy.
* A *Guideline* provides general statements, recommendations, and administrative instructions designed to achieve the policy's objectives by providing a framework within which to implement procedures. 
* A *Procedure* describe process: who does what, when they do it, and under what criteria. A procedure may contain multiple ways to achieve the objective and may or may not be mandatory, depending on what is stated in the associated standards document.

Corporate values drives principles, from which the specific policies are derived. Policies, in turn, drive standards, guidelines, and procedures.
Values are usually accompanied by a mission statement to clearly articulate a company's priority and focus.
